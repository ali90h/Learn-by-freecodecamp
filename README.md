Thanks freecodecamp.org

I really don't know what to say about this very wonderful camp. There are great efforts made by the team to spread education for all and free of charge. All one can do for all this effort is to support them.

This project I created to publish what they teach me.

Honestly, I'm not good at github either.

Forgive me if there are many mistakes
